Steps Followed to Reach the Final Script

Step 1: Initial Setup and Model Configuration
 - Objective: Create a reminder parsing tool that leverages OpenAI’s gpt-3.5-turbo model to interpret natural language inputs, extract reminder details, and handle date parsing.
 - Actions:
   - Set up OpenAI's model using ChatOpenAI from langchain_openai.
   - Defined a Reminder data structure using pydantic to standardize and structure the parsed output, including fields like task, start_date, frequency, time, context, and tags.
   - Configured the environment to load API keys and other credentials using dotenv.

Step 2: Constructing the Prompt
 - Objective: Guide the model to correctly interpret and extract relevant data fields from reminder text.
 - Actions:
   - Designed a PromptTemplate with detailed instructions, directing the model to extract key details (task, date, time, frequency, tags).
   - Instructed the model to output a relative date phrase (like “tomorrow” or “next week”) for the start_date_phrase field, instead of attempting exact date parsing. This would allow more reliable post-processing for date interpretation.

Step 3: Testing Date Parsing with LLM Output
 - Objective: Process start_date_phrase to obtain a specific date.
 - Challenges:
   - Initial attempts showed that OpenAI’s models sometimes output incorrect or ambiguous dates directly (e.g., a reminder for “day after tomorrow” might yield 13-11-2021).
   - This is because the model, while understanding relative terms, does not inherently know today’s date or have date-specific reasoning.
  - Solution:
    - Introduced parsedatetime and dateparser as Python libraries to process the start_date_phrase and convert relative terms into specific dates based on today’s date.

Step 4: Integrating parsedatetime and dateparser for Date Parsing
 - Objective: Convert relative date phrases (like “tomorrow” or “three days later”) into specific dates.
 - Actions:
   - Configured dateparser with a RELATIVE_BASE setting, so relative dates would be parsed based on today’s date.
   - Set PREFER_DATES_FROM to 'future' to bias the output toward future dates when parsing ambiguous terms.
   - Established parsedatetime as a fallback in case dateparser failed to interpret a date phrase, giving the parsing process more robustness.

Step 5: Handling Parsing Failures and Setting Default Dates
  - Objective: Ensure the system is reliable, even when a date phrase cannot be parsed.
  - Challenges:
    - Some date phrases were still failing to parse or returned dates in the past.
  - Solution:
    - Added a fallback to set the date to today’s date if both parsedatetime and dateparser failed.
    - Ensured default time settings (11:00 AM) were applied if the model did not return a specific time.

Challenges and Solutions

1. Challenge: Inconsistent Date Output from OpenAI Models
Problem: The model sometimes returned incorrect absolute dates when processing phrases like “next month” or “day after tomorrow” due to lack of real-time date awareness.
Solution: Changed the prompt to have the model output a start_date_phrase instead of an exact date. This allowed more precise handling by parsing libraries.

2. Challenge: Parsing Complex Relative Date Expressions
Problem: Relative expressions such as “three days after next Monday” were not always parsed correctly.
Solution: Integrated parsedatetime as a primary parser for date phrases, which has a strong capability for handling conversational date expressions. If it failed, the script fell back on dateparser with customized settings to ensure accuracy.

3. Challenge: Handling Fallback and Ensuring Reliability
Problem: Some date expressions still didn’t parse correctly, even after using two parsing libraries.
Solution: Added a final fallback to set the date to today’s date, ensuring no failed output. This provided a failsafe mechanism to always return a valid response, even if the exact date couldn’t be determined.

4. Challenge: Combining Multiple Libraries
Problem: Balancing the libraries and ensuring consistent, accurate outputs without conflicting results.
Solution: Defined a clear order of operations:
First, try dateparser with specified settings.
If dateparser fails, switch to parsedatetime.
If both fail, fallback to today’s date.


Summary of the Final Script
Model Output: The LLM produces a structured JSON output with fields for the reminder’s task, frequency, time, context, tags, and a start_date_phrase.
Date Parsing Logic:
The script first attempts to parse start_date_phrase with dateparser, configured to interpret relative terms based on the current date.
If dateparser fails, parsedatetime provides an alternative method for parsing the phrase.
Finally, it defaults to today’s date if both libraries cannot parse the phrase, ensuring a reliable output.
